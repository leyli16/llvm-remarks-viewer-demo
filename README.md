# LLVM Remarks Viewer Demo

This is a lightweight demo tool to **parse and visualize LLVM optimization remarks** (`.opt.json` files) generated by Clang. It helps developers understand what optimizations were applied (or missed) and why.

## 🔄 LLVM Remarks Visualization Flow

The diagram below shows the full process from compiling a C++ source file with Clang, to generating `.opt.json`, parsing it with Python, and displaying the result in a browser.

## 🛠 How It Works

1. **Compile a C++ file with optimization remarks enabled:**
   ```bash
   clang++ -O2 -fsave-optimization-record -foptimization-record-format=json example.cpp
   ```

2. **Run the Python parser:**
   ```bash
   python3 parse_remarks.py
   ```

3. **(Optional) View with the HTML page:**
   Start a local server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then open `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in your browser.

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Add filtering/grouping by optimization pass
- Highlight source location (file + line)
- Display summary statistics (counts, common passes)
- Explore LLM integration for explaining remarks
